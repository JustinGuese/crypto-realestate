##### Conclusion - Start Searching for Your Dream Home today!

With the popularity of homes in the virtual world, many people are considering just how easy it is to find a new home in the virtual world. Now that you know what's available on Decentraland, it's time to start searching! Whether you are looking for a catch-all home or just want to explore more of what we have to offer, now is the time to start looking for your new home. But how? Let's start with some basics. 
Decentraland is divided into parcels of land, each parcel having a unique address and public key, which are used to keep track of who owns what. You can think of it like an address book on the blockchain without strict borders or pre-defined cities (and without a need for paper). Each parcel of land, has a unique public key and address. You can find the addresses for all parcels here:https://explorer.decentraland.org/#/land-addresses/jsonpNow that we have an idea of what is available on Decentraland, we now know that we'll need to know the parcel of land's unique public key. How do we find them? For example, Alice is looking for a new home, so she goes to the address book on the blockchain and starts searching by land parcel number. We can see in her address book that her 2nd parcel of land is 18-D. We know that she needs to provide the public key for this parcel of land, so in order to move into her new home we have to find its address and use it to create a new Decentraland account.

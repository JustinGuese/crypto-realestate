The physical realm is becoming less important than ever before as people are getting used to living in a digital world. We are beginning to see changes in our society because of this new way of living. For example, children are spending less time playing outside and more time playing video games inside their homes or on their phones which have become an extension of themselves.
As virtual reality becomes more popular, we need to think about how it will affect our society as a whole and what regulations should be put in place to protect people from the dangers of living in a virtual world.

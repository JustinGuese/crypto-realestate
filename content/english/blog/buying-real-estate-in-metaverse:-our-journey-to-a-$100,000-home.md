## Introduction: Real Estate in Metaverse - What You Need to Know

Metaverse is a virtual reality [ platform ](https://accounts.binance.com/en/register?ref=37092355) that allows users to build, explore, and interact with digital assets. It has been around since 2013.
In the Metaverse, there are three types of land - public land, private land and restricted land. Public lands are open for everyone to explore and use it freely. Private lands can only be accessed by the owners or their authorized agents. Restricted lands can be accessed by those who have permission from its owner or the designated agent.
The Metaverse is a new way of living that is not limited to just gaming and socializing but also includes real estate development, home buying and selling, commerce, and other activities related to real estate.

### Mortgage vs. Title Only Transactions

Buying property on the blockchain is a much cheaper option than traditional mortgage loans. However, it’s still not possible for everyone. Title only transactions, also called "cash for keys" transactions, can be utilized by small businesses and individuals looking to [ buy ](https://accounts.binance.com/en/register?ref=37092355) a home without filing for a mortgage loan with lenders. In this transaction, the seller will give you all of the deeds to their property in exchange for your money instead of making bank payments on their behalf like a traditional title loan. This type of transaction is based off of value instead of contract agreements and is often contingent upon the market value at time of purchase. Title only transactions are worth exploring when buying property because they offer more options with less risk than using traditional financing options such as mortgages or title loans, which each come with their own set of requirements.
Title only transactions are a new way for the common public to [ buy ](https://accounts.binance.com/en/register?ref=37092355) property without having to go through traditional financing options such as mortgages or title loans. In this transaction, the seller gives you all of their deeds in exchange for your money instead of bank payments on their behalf like a traditional title loan. These types of transactions are based off value instead of loan size. For example; you might [ buy ](https://accounts.binance.com/en/register?ref=37092355) a home for $50,000 from the seller and agree to make quarterly payments of $2,000 for 20 years. This is referred to as a "pay-as-you-go" purchase agreement - but it doesn't have to be done this way. The advantage would be that if the house were to increase in value, your home loan would be reduced. Conversely, if the house were to decline in value, your monthly payments would increase.

####### The 3 Main Steps of Buying Property in Metaverse - How to Become Successful with Your First Transaction

If you want to [ buy ](https://accounts.binance.com/en/register?ref=37092355) property in Metaverse and become successful with your first transaction, there are three steps that you should follow.
Find a piece of land: If you want to [ buy ](https://accounts.binance.com/en/register?ref=37092355) property on virtual land, the best way is to find one that’s already listed on the market.
Get permission: Your next step is to get permission from the owner of the land so that you can use it for your transactions. In some cases, they might have an option where they allow you to set up a mini game if it creates some kind of value for them, but this usually happens when an owner finds too many people wanting to use their land without being able to sell them or rent them out
Finalize the purchase: The last step is to finalize the purchase of the land. This is done by sending the agreed-upon amount of Metaverse to the owner of the land.

######## What is an Initial Token Offering and how does it Work?

An ICO is an Initial Coin Offering that is a new way of crowdfunding. It is a method of raising funds for a new cryptocurrency project by selling the cryptocurrency tokens to early adopters and enthusiasts.
An ICO can be done in two ways: either the company sets up their own ICO or they use an existing [ platform ](https://accounts.binance.com/en/register?ref=37092355) like Indiegogo or Kickstarter to raise funds.
There are three types of tokens that are used in an ICO: utility token, security token, and asset token. Utility tokens allow users to use the service on the [ platform ](https://accounts.binance.com/en/register?ref=37092355) and have no rights to any ownership in the company. Security tokens give investors voting rights, dividends, and other rights that come with owning shares of a company. Asset tokens represent ownership over assets such as real estate or works of art and allow investors to sell them while also offering a relatively low-cost way to obtain these assets.
